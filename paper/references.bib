@article{s21062132,
  abstract       = {Robot grasping is an important direction in intelligent robots. However, how to help robots grasp specific objects in multi-object scenes is still a challenging problem. In recent years, due to the powerful feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNN), various algorithms based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed to solve the problem of grasp detection. Different from anchor-based grasp detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a keypoint-based scheme to solve this problem. We model an object or a grasp as a single point—the center point of its bounding box. The detector uses keypoint estimation to find the center point and regress to all other object attributes such as size, direction, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of this method is 74.3% in the multi-object grasp dataset VMRD, and the performance on the single-object scene Cornell dataset is competitive with the current state-of-the-art grasp detection algorithm. Robot experiments demonstrate that this method can help robots grasp the target in single-object and multi-object scenes with overall success rates of 94% and 87%, respectively.},
