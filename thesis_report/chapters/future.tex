\chapter{Future Scope}
As the Keypointnet is limited by the manifold losses for training objects with rotation in range $[0, \pi]$, a newer formulation will be engineered and applied.
Furthermore, KeypointNet and \ac{DON} will be expanded to accommodate objects belonging to different classes.\\

As of this writing, the \ac{DON} training cannot accommodate multiple similar object in an image as it is limited by the presented loss functions \parencites{florence2020dense}{adrian2022efficient}.
To overcome this, ``Ranked InfoNCE Loss'' \cite{hoffmann2022ranking} will be adopted on the pixelwise scale to train \ac{DON} accommodating multiple similar
objects in a scene.\\

To build up appropriate states for the future robot path planning and grasping using model-based reinforcement learning \cite{kaiser2019model},
\ac{DON} computed dense descriptor image will be encoded to a vector
state $x \in \mathbb{R}^D$ instead of $I_D \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times D}$ with the neural networks inspired from \cite{tschannen2018recent} for faster online training.
The robot path planning will be based on the KeypointNet alternatively to the method trajectory generation proposed in \parencites{florence2019self}.
